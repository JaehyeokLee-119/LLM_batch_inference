        "question": "<Passage>: Although many seventeenth-century broadsides, popular ballads printed on a single sheet of paper and widely sold by street peddlers, were moralizing in nature, this is not evidence that most seventeenth-century people were serious about moral values. While over half of surviving broadsides contain moralizing statements, and it is known that many people purchased such compositions, it is not known why they did so, nor is it known how their own beliefs related to what they read.\n<Question>: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?\n\u30fbIn many moralizing ballads, the moral content was confined to a single stanza expressing a pious sentiment tacked onto a sensationalized account of crime and adultery. The moral content is not limited to a single stanza expressing impious sentiments tacked on to sensationalized accounts of crime and adultery in many moralistic ballads. It is known that many people purchase such compositions and that over half of the survived broadside contains moralistic statements, but it is unknown why they do it and how their beliefs relate to what they read. (A)\n\u30fbWell-educated people of the seventeenth century held broadsides in contempt and considered broadside peddlers to be disreputable vagrants.  It is known that many people purchase such compositions and that over half of the survived broadside contains moralistic statements, but it is unknown why they do it and how their beliefs relate to what they read. (B)\n\u30fbThe clergy occasionally stuck broadsides warning about the danger of strong drink on the doors of seventeenth-century alehouses. The clergy never stuck a broadside warning of the dangers of weak drinking to the occasional door of a seventeenth-century alehouse. It is known that many people purchase such compositions and that over half of the survived broadside contains moralistic statements, but it is unknown why they do it and how their beliefs relate to what they read. (C)\n\u30fbSome seventeenth-century ballad sellers also sold sermons printed in pamphlet form.  It is known that many people purchase such compositions and that over half of the survived broadside contains moralistic statements, but it is unknown why they do it and how their beliefs relate to what they read.

By contrast, the price of soybeans has long remained stable. Knowing that cotton plants mature quickly, many soybean growers in Ortovia plan to cease growing soybeans and begin raising cotton instead, thereby taking advantage of the high price of cotton to increase their income significantly, at least over the next several years.\n<Question>: Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the plan's chances for success?\n\u30fbTests of a newly developed, inexpensive pesticide have shown it to be both environmentally safe and effective against the insects that have infested cotton crops. Tests of new uncostly, environmentally safe pesticides that are effective in countering insect infestations in cotton crops show both environmental safety and effectiveness.

        "question": "<Passage>: Passenger volume in the airline industry has declined dramatically over the past two years, and thus fewer travelers and fewer planes are using airports. Since airport expansion can be warranted only by increases in air traffic volume, and since it will probably be at least five years before passenger volume returns to and then exceeds its previous level, it seems surprising that now is the time that airports are going ahead with plans to expand their passenger terminal facilities.\n<Question>: Which one of the following, if true, provides the best reason in favor of the airports' timing of their planned expansions?\n\u30fbWhen passenger volume begins to grow again after a period of decline, most airlines can, initially, absorb the increase without adding new routes or new planes. When passenger volumes begin to grow again after declining, most airlines can initially absorb the increase without adding new planes to existing routes. Over the past two years, the passenger volume in the airline industry has declined dramatically, with less planes and less travelers using the airports. It seems surprising that the airport is now going ahead with its plans to expand its passenger terminal, which was then at the time, as it is probably five years before volume returns to previous levels and exceeds and expansion of the airport may only warrant an increase in air traffic volume. (A)\n\u30fbA sustained decline in passenger travel could lead to the failure of many airlines and the absorption of their routes by those airlines that survive. Sustainable declines in passenger travel could lead to those survivent airlines absorbing their routes and many airlines failing.

Major construction projects are generally not more easy to finance in times of economic decline.
