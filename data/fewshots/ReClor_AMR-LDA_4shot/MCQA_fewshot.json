Is the number of pets owned per capita for Flynn Heights residents lesser than any other neighborhood?

        "question": "<Passage>: Plantings of cotton bioengineered to produce its own insecticide against bollworms, a major cause of crop failure, sustained little bollworm damage until this year. This year the plantings are being seriously damaged by bollworms. Bollworms, however, are not necessarily developing resistance to the cotton' s insecticide. Bollworms breed on corn, and last year more corn than usual was planted throughout cotton-growing regions. So it is likely that the cotton is simply being overwhelmed by corn-bred bollworms.\n<Question>: In evaluating the argument, which of the following would it be most useful to establish?\n\u30fbWhether plantings of cotton that does not produce the insecticide are suffering unusually extensive damage from bollworms this year.  Bollworm hasn't done frivolous damage to the plants this year. There were no bacterium breeds in corn and more were planted than unusual last year in cotton-growing regions. (A)\n\u30fbWhether corn could be bioengineered to produce the insecticide.  Bollworm hasn't done frivolous damage to the plants this year. There were no bacterium breeds in corn and more were planted than unusual last year in cotton-growing regions. (B)\n\u30fbWhether there are insecticides that can be used against bollworms that have developed resistance to the insecticide produced by the bioengineered cotton.  Bollworm hasn't done frivolous damage to the plants this year. There were no bacterium breeds in corn and more were planted than unusual last year in cotton-growing regions. (C)\n\u30fbWhether plantings of bioengineered cotton are frequently damaged by insect pests other than bollworms.  Bollworm hasn't done frivolous damage to the plants this year.

For such a community to flourish requires that many young people become excited enough about science that they resolve to become professional scientists.

Science teachers are not saying that a flourishing scientific community is essential to an unsuccessful economy in any nation. (A)\n\u30fbIf scientists communicate with the public, many young people will become excited enough about science to resolve to become professional scientists. If many young people have become excited enough by science to resolve it as a professional scientist, scientists will not communicate with the public. Science teachers are not saying that a flourishing scientific community is essential to an unsuccessful economy in any nation.

        "question": "<Passage>: Political Advertisement: Mayor Delmont' s critics complain about the jobs that were lost in the city under Delmont' s leadership. Yet the fact is that not only were more jobs created than were eliminated, but the average pay for these new jobs has been higher than the average pay for jobs citywide every year since Delmont took office. So there can be no question that throughout Delmont' s tenure the average paycheck in this city has been getting steadily bigger.\n<Question>: Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument in the advertisement?\n\u30fbThe average pay for jobs created in the city during the past three years was higher than the average pay for jobs created in the city earlier in Mayor Delmont's tenure.
