        "question": "<Passage>: Physician: In order to investigate diseases caused by hormonal imbalances, a certain researcher wants to study, among others, 200 children whose pituitary glands fail to produce typical amounts of Human Growth Hormone (HGH). The study would involve administering a synthetic version of HGH to the children over a two-year period. But medical research should be permitted only if it is likely to reveal important information about a medical condition and is known to pose only a minimal risk to the subjects. The researcher' s proposed study should be prohibited.\nWhich one of the following, if true, would most help to justify the physician's argumentation?\n\u30fb About 10, 000 children have already been given synthetic HGH without obvious side effects. (A)\n\u30fb Obtaining informed consent from children is impossible, because they are not yet mature enough to understand complex medical issues. (B)\n\u30fb Although hormonal imbalances can cause disease, the imbalances themselves do not constitute a medical condition. (C)\n\u30fb The long-term effects of synthetic HGH have never been tested and are unknown. (D)\n\n\n<Question>: Is the option \"\u30fb Obtaining informed consent from children is impossible, because they are not yet mature enough to understand complex medical issues. (B)\" is a correct answer?",

        "question": "<Passage>: Researcher: The vast majority of a person' s dreams bear no resemblance whatsoever to real events that follow the dreams. Thus, it is unreasonable to believe that one has extrasensory perception solely on the basis of having had several vivid dreams about events that happen after the dreams.\nWhich one of the following arguments is most similar in its reasoning to the argument above?\n\u30fb A number of people who die prematurely take aspirin. But it is unreasonable to conclude that aspirin is dangerous. Most people who take aspirin do not die prematurely. (A)\n\u30fb Even though many cancer patients experience remissions without drinking herbal tea, it is unreasonable to believe that not drinking herbal tea causes such remissions. Several factors are known to be relevant to cancer remission. (B)\n\u30fb Many people who undergo surgery for ulcers show no long-term improvement. So it is unreasonable to believe that surgery for ulcers is effective, even though ulcer surgery benefits many people as well. (C)\n\u30fb A significant number of children raised near power lines develop cancer. So it is unreasonable to deny a connection between living near power lines and developing cancer, even though many people living near power lines never develop cancer.

        "question": "<Passage>: There should be a greater use of gasohol. Gasohol is a mixture of alcohol and gasoline, and has a higher octane rating and fewer carbon monoxide emissions than straight gasoline. Burning gasohol adds no more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than plants remove by photosynthesis.\nEach of the following, if true, strengthens the argument above EXCEPT:\n\u30fb Cars burn on the average slightly more gasohol per kilometer than they do gasoline. (A)\n\u30fb Cars run less well on gasoline than they do on gasohol. (B)\n\u30fb Since less gasoline is needed with the use of gasohol, an energy shortage is less likely. (C)\n\u30fb Gasohol is cheaper to produce and hence costs less at the pump than gasoline.

        "question": "<Passage>: Walter: For the economically privileged in a society to tolerate an injustice perpetrated against one of society' s disadvantaged is not just morally wrong but also shortsighted: a system that inflicts an injustice on a disadvantaged person today can equally well inflict that same injustice on a well-to-do person tomorrow. Larissa: In our society, the wealthy as well as the well-educated can protect themselves against all sorts of injustices suffered by the less well-off. Allowing such injustices to persist is bad policy not because it places everyone at equal risk of injustice but because it is a potent source of social unrest.\nLarissa responds to Walter by doing which one of the following?\n\u30fb charging Walter with stopping short of recognizing the full implications of his position (A)\n\u30fb questioning Walter's authority to address matters of social policy (B)\n\u30fb drawing implausible consequences from Walter's assumptions (C)\n\u30fb providing an alternative reason for accepting the truth of Walter's conclusion (D)\n\n\n<Question>: Is the option \"\u30fb providing an alternative reason for accepting the truth of Walter's conclusion (D)\" is a correct answer?",
