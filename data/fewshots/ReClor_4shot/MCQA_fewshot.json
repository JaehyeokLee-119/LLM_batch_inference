        "question": "<Passage>: An economist has argued that consumers often benefit when government permits a corporation to obtain a monopoly. Without competition, a corporation can raise prices without spending nearly as much on advertising. The corporation can then invest the extra money in expensive research or industrial infrastructure that it could not otherwise afford, passing the fruits of these investments on to consumers.\n<Question>: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the economist's argument?\nChoose the correct answer from the following options.\n\u30fb If a corporation obtains a monopoly, the disadvantage to consumers of any higher prices will be outweighed by the advantages from extra investments in expensive research or industrial infrastructure made by that corporation. (A)\n\u30fb The government's permitting a corporation to obtain a monopoly is advantageous for consumers only if that corporation passes the fruits of at least some of its investments on to consumers. (B)\n\u30fb The benefits to consumers are typically greater if a corporation invests in expensive research or industrial infrastructure than if that corporation spends the same amount of money in any other way. (C)\n\u30fb Even if a corporation is not permitted to obtain a monopoly, it typically invests some money in expensive research or industrial infrastructure. (D)\n\n\nWhat is the correct answer?",

        "question": "<Passage>: Ethicist: Marital vows often contain the promise to love \"until death do us part. \" If \"love\" here refers to a feeling, then this promise makes no sense, for feelings are not within one' s control, and a promise to do something not within one' s control makes no sense. Thus, no one -- including those making marital vows -- should take \"love\" in this context to be referring to feelings.\n<Question>: The ethicist's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?\nChoose the correct answer from the following options.\n\u30fb People should not make promises to do something that is not within their control. (A)\n\u30fb Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense. (B)\n\u30fb Promises that cannot be kept do not make any sense. (C)\n\u30fb \"Love\" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings. (D)\n\n\nWhat is the correct answer?",

        "question": "<Passage>: Political analyst: Several years ago, McFarlane, the military dictator, had Brooks, the former prime minister, arrested on charges of corruption. After years of negotiation, McFarlane has pardoned Brooks, and she has agreed to join his government. Almost all of McFarlane' s supporters believe that Brooks is guilty of corruption. Moreover, almost all of McFarlane' s opponents will oppose anyone who agrees to join his government. So Brooks will have few supporters in this country.\n<Question>: The political analyst's argument depends on the assumption that\nChoose the correct answer from the following options.\n\u30fb there is less corruption in the country's government now than when Brooks was prime minister (A)\n\u30fb most people in the country are either supporters or opponents of McFarlane (B)\n\u30fb the charges on which Brooks was arrested were unfounded (C)\n\u30fb Brooks's joining McFarlane's government inappropriately gives that government a semblance of legitimacy (D)\n\n\nWhat is the correct answer?",

        "question": "<Passage>: The Great Sphinx is a huge statue in Egypt that has a lion' s body with a man' s head. The face of the Sphinx has long been claimed to be that of pharaoh Khafre, who lived around 2600 B. C. , but it cannot be: erosion patterns recently discovered on the lion' s legs can only have been caused by heavy rains, and the Sahara has not had heavy rains in over 10, 000 years.\n<Question>: Which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?\nChoose the correct answer from the following options.\n\u30fb Other erosion patterns that appear on the body of the Sphinx are of a sort that could be caused by wind and sand alone (A)\n\u30fb The face of the Sphinx bears a resemblance to the faces on certain stylized statues dating from both before and after the reign of Khafre. (B)\n\u30fb Other than the Sphinx, there are no surviving sculptures that have been claimed to portray the face of Khafre. (C)\n\u30fb The face of the Sphinx is small relative to the rest of the head, indicating that the face may have been recarved long after the Sphinx was built. (D)\n\n\nWhat is the correct answer?",
